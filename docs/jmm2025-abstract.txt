Abstract:
A plane graph is defined to be an embedding on a planar point set such that the edges are non-crossing line segments. Such graphs are useful, since they model many real-world phenomena. For this reason, plane graphs have been extensively studied. In this project, we study properties of a random plane graph, uniformly chosen from the set of graphs that can be embedded over a fixed point set. While there is a significant body of knowledge about the behavior of random graphs, the standard tools break down for plane graphs. Hardly anything is known in this case.

We derive bounds on the expected vertex degrees in a random plane graph of a fixed planar point set. Our proofs are based on cross-graph charging. That is, we move charge across vertices of different graphs, to obtain properties of an average graph.
